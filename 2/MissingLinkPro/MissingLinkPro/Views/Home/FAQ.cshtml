                What you see is the result of those changes that take place. The available data at lower ranks in your search are the most likely to be affected by these changes, which is why duplicates are more likely to appear with larger search requests.</p><br />

        <tr>
            <td><p>The search engine stores millions of indexed results that are anywhere from extremely relevant to completely irrelevant to your search.
                However, only a small fraction of those results are available at a time, and this fraction is limited to one thousand at the very most.
                These results are constantly changing with current trends, so the results that you get at a given time of day may be different at another.</p><br />

                Though the tool does its best to accommodate for this, some sites simply aren't configured to handle requests made through web applications.
                Thankfully, such sites are uncommon, and their links are available to you in your results.</p><br />

                the site it is trying to contact. This tends to happen with the more suspicious-looking sites that appear in the search results.
